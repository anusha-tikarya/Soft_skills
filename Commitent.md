## Commitment:
Commitment is a firm dedication to a cause, goal, or activity. It involves staying loyal and consistently putting in effort over the long term, often requiring sacrifices and a high level of responsibility.

## Interest:
Interest refers to a desire, curiosity, or enthusiasm about something. It is often short-term and based on initial attraction or curiosity, and it does not necessarily involve a deep level of responsibility or long-term dedication.

## Short Summary of "Are You INTERESTED Or Are You COMMITTED?" by John Assaraf

Alan Brown taught me that being interested in goals means doing what’s convenient, while commitment means doing whatever it takes. Commitment involves taking immediate, consistent actions, upgrading skills, and overcoming excuses. To achieve goals, write down specific goals and action steps, and follow through with daily efforts. Success depends on the commitment to act, not just hope or wish.

never give up, even when things are tough. It tells stories of people who kept going despite failures, eventually achieving amazing success. It encourages everyone to believe in themselves and keep pushing forward, no matter what obstacles they face.


## summary based on Brendan's words and the lessons learned:
1. **Commit to Your Passions**: Only agree to things you genuinely care about and have a passion for. Avoid saying yes out of obligation, which can lead to breaking commitments later.
2. **Respect Others' Time**: Treat other people's time with the same importance as your own. Cancelling commitments casually can damage relationships and trust.
3. **Remember Your Why**: Before committing to something, remind yourself why you agreed to it in the first place. This helps you stay focused and committed.
4. **Repair Broken Commitments**: If you do break a commitment, make amends. Show generosity and apologize sincerely to rebuild trust and maintain your integrity. 5. **Integrity Matters**: Consistently keeping your word and respecting others' time builds your reputation and integrity. It's about being reliable and responsible in all your commitments. These points emphasize the importance of aligning your actions with your values, respecting others, and taking responsibility when things don't go as planned.
