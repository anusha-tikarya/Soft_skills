Handling customers with these specific traits can be challenging but manageable with the right approach. Here’s how you might handle each type:

1. **Talkative Customer:**
   - **Approach:** Listen actively and patiently while steering the conversation towards the issue at hand.
   - **Strategy:** Politely redirect the conversation to focus on resolving their concern. Use active listening to show you value their input without letting them dominate the interaction indefinitely.

2. **Angry Customer:**

## Role Play
Sheela and her team are creating a tool for a telecommunication client to track issues reported by its customers. The team was on schedule before their city was hit by a flood, affecting everyday life and work. Post the calamity, the team reworked the project schedule and identified a delay of three weeks in delivering the final product. The team informs the client and decides to have a meeting to discuss the issue.

Do a role play to enact this scenario.

## Team 3 & 4
Tom, a maintenance technician, responded to queries quickly and was equally quick in resolving them. He enjoyed being a technician and took pride in being technically perfect. However, when Tom was asked by his manager if his customers understood how he managed to solve the problem or what feedback they had about their service he couldn’t really deliver an answer. Later in the day, while speaking to another colleague he says, “If my manager thinks I'm going to tell someone, ‘I’m here to assist you’ or ‘Is there anything else I can do to help’ then he is mistaken. I’m not anyone’s servant, especially if they made the mistake. I am glad to help them, but I'm certainly not here to serve people.

Describe the challenges Tom would have in delivering great customer service and what he could do to overcome this problem.

## Role Play
You receive a call from a caller who seems to be in a bad mood right from the beginning of the call. He complains that he has not been able to access his ABC application since last week. He is very upset and does not allow you to speak much. He is unwilling to answer many questions saying he already explained all this to the previous person. Unfortunately, the person who handled the caller previously, failed to document all the information in the ticket; leaving you, with not much of a history to work with.

After 25 minutes of investigation and a lot of sarcasm from the caller, you identify that the caller initially had only temporary access to the application and that his access has expired. If he requires permanent access, it would require him to follow the below steps:

Write to his manager requesting for permanent access along with the reasons for the requirement Forward the approval email that he receives from his manager to helpdesk@outlook.com Raise a new ticket under the category “Application Access” Under the field ‘duration of access’, select “Permanent” as the default selection will be temporary. He would receive an email within 2 business days with new login details to the application.

Good customer service indeed revolves around the 3 P's: People, Process, and Product. Here's a breakdown of each:

1. **People**: This refers to the employees or customer service representatives who directly interact with customers. They should be well-trained, empathetic, and skilled in handling various customer inquiries or issues. People also include having the right number of staff to ensure prompt service and reducing customer wait times. Hiring the right people, training them effectively, and empowering them to make decisions that benefit the customer are crucial aspects of this P.

2. **Process**: This involves the procedures and systems in place to ensure consistent and efficient customer service delivery. It includes how customer inquiries are handled, how orders are processed, how complaints are escalated, and how feedback is collected and acted upon. A streamlined and well-defined process helps in maintaining consistency and meeting customer expectations at every touchpoint.

3. **Product**: This refers to the actual goods or services provided to customers. Products should meet quality standards, be reliable, and fulfill the promises made to customers. Good customer service can be undermined if the product does not perform as expected or if there are issues with its quality or usability. Ensuring that products meet or exceed customer expectations is crucial for maintaining satisfaction and loyalty.

By focusing on all three P's—People, Process, and Product—organizations can build a solid foundation for delivering excellent customer service consistently, leading to happier customers and ultimately, business success.
