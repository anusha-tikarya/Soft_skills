## The Cookie Thief: A Poem About How Oblivious We Can Be to How Wrong We Can Be

"The Cookie Thief" is a poem that humorously yet poignantly 
illustrates how easily we can misjudge situations and people due to our biases and assumptions. 
The poem follows a woman who buys a bag of cookies at an airport and sits down to read a book while waiting for her flight.
As she reads, she notices a man sitting next to her, seemingly eating her cookies. She grows increasingly irritated and indignant as he
helps himself to one cookie after another, all the while thinking how rude he is. 

In the end, when only one cookie is left,
the man breaks it in half, offers her a piece, 
and then leaves. When her flight is called, the woman stands up and discovers her own unopened bag of cookies in her bag,
realizing that she had been eating the man’s cookies the entire time. 

The poem highlights how we can be blind to our own mistakes and quick to judge others unfairly.
It serves as a reminder to be more self-aware and cautious about making assumptions.

## Here’s a summary of the key points:

1. **Remember the importance of perception & think outside the box** - Understand that perception is crucial and try to see things differently.
2. **Draw on the perspective of your team** - Use your team’s diverse viewpoints to gain new insights.
3. **Take a step back – The Creative Pause (Edward de Bono)** - Pause and rethink situations to come up with creative solutions.
4. **Ensure thought is followed by action** - Act on your ideas and plans.
5. **View problems as challenges and opportunities for improvement** - See problems as chances to grow and improve.
6. **Look for opportunities to create solutions** - Seek out ways to solve issues creatively.
7. **Evaluate, Improve, Polish & Market ideas for them to add value** - Refine and promote ideas to maximize their impact.

 **Divergence and convergence** are two essential phases in the creative problem-solving process. Here's a brief explanation of each:



### Divergence:
- **Definition**: This is the phase where you generate a wide variety of ideas, options, and possibilities without judgment or immediate evaluation.
- **Purpose**: To explore a broad range of potential solutions and perspectives.
- **Methods**:
  - **Brainstorming**: Generate as many ideas as possible.
  - **Mind Mapping**: Visualize and connect ideas freely.
  - **Free Writing**: Write continuously without worrying about coherence or grammar to uncover new thoughts.

### Convergence:
- **Definition**: This is the phase where you narrow down the options, evaluate them, and select the most viable and effective solutions.
- **Purpose**: To refine, prioritize, and implement the best ideas generated during the divergence phase.
- **Methods**:
  - **Evaluation Criteria**: Apply specific criteria to judge the feasibility and impact of each idea.
  - **Pros and Cons Analysis**: List the advantages and disadvantages of each option.
  - **Decision-Making Tools**: Use tools like SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) to make informed choices.

### Combining Both:
1. **Divergence Phase**:
   - Encourage open-mindedness and free thinking.
   - Suspend judgment to allow creativity to flow.
   - Generate as many ideas as possible.

2. **Convergence Phase**:
   - Apply critical thinking to evaluate ideas.
   - Select the most promising ideas for further development.
   - Plan and implement the chosen solutions.

By balancing divergence and convergence, you can harness creativity while ensuring practical and effective outcomes.

### Approaches to Creativity

1. **Technical Creativity** consists of two main strands:
   
   - **Programmed Thinking**:
     - Involves logical or structured ways of creation.
     - This approach is **convergent**, focusing on refining and implementing ideas systematically.
     
   - **Lateral Thinking**:
     - Encourages free flow of thought, random inputs, and brainstorming.
     - This approach is **divergent**, aiming to generate a wide range of ideas and perspectives.

In summary, programmed thinking is structured and convergent, 
while lateral thinking is more freeform and divergent. Both approaches are essential for fostering creativity and problem-solving.
